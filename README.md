# Data Analysis and Visualization in Python

## 1. Comparison of House Prices before and after a recession

Pandas library is used to appropriately sort through house data in the United States, and then after achieving the intended changes, a t-test is performed on the data to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts, compared to at the recession bottom.

## 2. Tracking Record high and low temperatures over 10 years.

In this assignment, data on temperature was used to create a visualization of record high temperatures in the area of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Points at which the previous temperature record were exceeded are also denoted. The nature of what this graph tracks is useful for keeping track of climate change. 

## 3. Creating a Custom Visualization

Randomly generated numbers into a dataframe are plotted and visualized in the form of a bar chart. A point of interest on the y-axis is identified, and colours are also used to help convey how much further the bar graph value is from the y-axis value of interest.

## 4. Link between Household income and sports participation in Singapore

Data was acquired on 1) Weekly Sports participation (https://www.msf.gov.sg/research-and-data/Research-and-Statistics/PublishingImages), and 2) Yearly income of families. A correlation between these two factors was thus visualized, observing that an increase in financial stability corresponded to an increase in leisurely activities (of which sports is one).
